                <h3>Early life and education</h3>
                <p>Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of oil presser (Modh-Ghanchi) which is an Other Backward Class (OBC) category in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (1915-1989) and Hiraben Modi (1923-2022).

                    Modi had infrequently worked as a child in his father's tea business on the Vadnagar railway station platform, according to Modi and his neighbours.
                    
                    Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967. his teachers described him as an average student and a keen, gifted debater with an interest in theatre. He preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.</p>

                     <h3>Early political career</h3>
                     <p>Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing activities in Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he researched and wrote the RSS's history of the Emergency. Shortly after, he returned to Gujarat and in 1985, the RSS assigned him to the BJP. In 1987, Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably,according to biographers, Modi's planning was responsible for the win.After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the party. Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role. Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.</p>

                <h3>Inauguration ceremonies</h3>
                <p>Since becoming prime minister, Modi and his team has made sure that he presides over all the important public events such as the inauguration of the new Indian parliament building,the ground breaking ceremony of the Ayodhya temple,the opening of a new corridor going towards the Kashi Vishwanath temple and the installation of the statue of Lord Ram in the newly built Ayodhya temple.He also flags off all the new services of the high speed "Vande Bharat" trains.He has faced criticism from the opposition for violating the protocol by opening the new parliament complex himself rather than by the president of India, the highest executive of the country.Many religious figures stayed away from the opening of the Ayodhya temple because construction was not complete at the time of the consecration, and therefore against Hindu scriptures in their opinion.</p>

                <h3>Social media</h3>
                <p>One of the main strategies used by Narendra Modi and his government has been the extensive use of Social media to directly communicate with the public. In September 2014 Modi became the second-most-followed leader in the world with 5 million Twitter followers.Modi's 31 August 2012 post on the, now defunct, Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with the public on live chat.Modi was the second-most-followed leader in the world with over 30 million followers on Twitter, as of June 2017 behind only Barack Obama.</p>
